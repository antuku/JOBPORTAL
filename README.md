Hi,
I am ANTU KUNDU, a student of INFORAMTION TECHNOLOGY of RCC INSTITUTE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, Kolkata, India. The Jobportal website(link: https://antukundujobportal.000webhostapp.com/) is made by me. This .txt file is the documentation of the Portal. Please Read this documentation throughoutly before accessing the portal or website.

My website consists of the following panels:

1. Home: It is the homepage of my website.
2. Hiring now: Here you can see the posted jobs and can apply for centain jobs. When you apply for centain jobs, it will take you to the "Apply Now" page, basically it is a sign up page, where you can registered yourself to the website by giving your personal information and  can set your own user name & password to log in through user login panel.
3. Contact: Here you can find my contact information such as my contact no., email-id, home address and my own portfolio website (link: https://antukundu1.wixsite.com/mysite). Basically, this panel is for contact purpose.
4. User Login: Through this panel, you can login to your profile to see your personal information which you had submitted and your job status(pending/approved). In this panel, there is an another section that is "change password", where you can change your current password.
5. Admin Login: When you click this certain link, it will take you to "Login to Admin Portal". You can login the panel using The username: admin, password: admin123.
It will take you to the home page dashboard. There is no function of dashboard, it is only for the landing page reason. In the panel you will see the following subpanels:

On the right site of the User panel, There is a small panel, where the admin can see his profile (he can change his profile details also in there) and can sign out from the admin panel.
N.B: It is recommanded to open the admin panel in Desktop mode of mobile. It will be better if you access my website in Desktop/Laptop.
